# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* 
Responsive web design is the concept of making your website or web application more accessible and readable to all users.  Responsive web design encompasses things as subtle as not using red/green to contrast one another (color-blind) to optimizing your page for various platforms (tablets, mobile devices, computers, etc).  

I am still learning about responsive design, but I like what I know.  I have a business background, so I certainly see the value of being able to reach a wider audience.  Clearly, responsive design is a good practice because you are opening your product up to a wider audience.  If your site/web app causes epileptic seizures or descriminates against a certain demographic (visually impaired or hearing impaired for example) then you might be facing legal troubles.  

In general, it just seems like a good practice to optimize your page for all platforms and potential users.

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* 
Tablets and smartphones have changed web design because there are hundreds of smartphone/tablet options.  Due to this, web designers must follow different web standards to ensure that their websites/applications will work and look nice on all platforms.  Technology will continue to affect web design as it evolves.  As products like Google Glass and Oculus become more prevalent, we will see websites optimized for their usage.  For this reason, web designers must be agile. 


* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* 
Of course visually impaired individuals can use the web.  They use the web by using screen readers.  Visually impaired users are able to scroll through the site by using tab, which will read aloud what they are scrolling over.  

Of course we should develop for the visually impaired. According to http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs282/en/, 285 million people worldwide are blind.  It is certainly likely that not all of these people have access to the web, but if even a small percentage have access, we should develop with them in mind. 

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* 
I have been working in the mobile industry for a few years at Verizon Wireless, so I was definitely cognizant of the need to optimize your webpages for multiple platforms.  The concept of optimizing your site with 'accessibility' in mind resonated with me the most.  There are certain demographics that I wouldn't initially consider when building my site, if I were to start today.  For example, I would not have known to optimize my site for the visually impaired.  In the future, I will make sure that I keep all potential users in mind when building a web app/website.

Nothing about this section was 'stupid'.  I understand everything for the most part.  I need to work on converting from px to em, so I am able to do so a little more quickly.
