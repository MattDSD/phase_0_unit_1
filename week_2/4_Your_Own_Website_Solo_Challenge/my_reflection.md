Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? I learned that it takes a great deal of careful work to get to design the site just the way that you want it.  I also learned that getting used to CSS positioning takes some trial and error.  
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too) I do like design and UX.  It was a lot of fun to work through the design phase of my site.  I actually enjoy designing the site just as much as like building it.  Both take time and consideration and I think both are equally important.  Wireframing isn't exactly my jam, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it in the best way possible.  Wireframing reminds me of building a storyboard through Xcode. 
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work? My process was to build a mockup using a third party application.  I designed exactly how I wanted the site to look in my head and created a mockup.  I then found color schemes and fonts that I wanted using UI Flat Colors and Whatfont? dev tool.  Everything worked perfectly well.  The only thing I struggled with a bit is padding/alignment for all of my div's.  Building it the way that it is took probably 8 hours.  
* What would you like to add or change about the site next? I would like to embed my most recent blog posts once I have an updated blog.  I want to take a picture of myself using a professional camera and add some font effects to the top toolbar.  Otherwise, I am happy with my first index.html. 
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool? Again, it took time to get used to the spacing.  That being said, yes it was difficult.  After hours upon hours of messing around with the site, I finally got it to work.  The coolest things that I found in my research was UI Flat colors and Whatfont? Chrome dev tools. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
