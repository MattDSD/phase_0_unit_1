# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it? I believe the DOM is a hierarchy for how your page should be laid out.  It includes HTML, CSS, and XML.  It basically explains that there is a hierarchy for everything for example ul -> li.  I think I understand the structure and the spacing necessary to create a page.  I guess I don't know what I don't know at this point.  I think I am on board.  Everything seems fine about this section.  I actually like the new semantic hierarchy of a page.  It is a bit more obvious what every section represents when I go through the code. 
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare? I used chrome web tools to inspect each individual element.  I also was able to use other tools like 'Whatfont?' and 'colorzilla', which helped me determine which colors are on a page.  
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with? I found Chrome Web tools extremely easy and pleasurable to work wth.  The CSS inspection tool took a few minutes to get used to but once I did, it was a pleasure to use. 
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified? I think my largest aha moment from this section came when I finally figured out that I had to 'inspect' each individual element and not just the entire page at one time. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
* 
Not for this section.
