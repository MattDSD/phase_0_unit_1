##QUIZ
* Explain which tabs support the following actions and how.
  * Realtime editing of HTML and CSS- Elements/Styles/computed tabs would be the location where you would primarily work on this. You will mostly edit HTML from the elements tab and CSS is mostly done in the Styles and Computed tabs. 
  * Javascript Debugging- Sources tab will be the best location to run Javascript commands. 
  * Performance Optimization- This is mostly handled from the Network tab.  You will use this section to determine if you have errors or certain functions that are bogging down your web applications. 

* What's the quick key for your OS to spawn the Dev Tools inspector? Command + option + I or you can just right click and click "inspect element".

* Go to http://www.postmachina.com/ and analyze and tweak this nicely designed page.
  * What is the current background color for the page? #0b0f11
  * Tweak the background color to white. done 
  * Tweak the height of the side bar that contains the logo.  Shrink it down to 85px. done
  * Roll over the navigation links.  When you hover over them, they dissapear.  Let's change the hover color to black instead. done 
  * Now take a screenshot of your new (and maybe not so improved) design.  It should match this screenshot: http://postimg.org/image/5ak1jkpl5/ done 
  * Upload your own image to the web using an image hosting service.  It should match the image above. The last nav link in the image above is black because the mouse was hovering there when the screenshot was taken. Do the same, and don't take a screenshot of your whole desktop, just the browser window. (This is part of the challenge.) done 

* For the postmachina website, why can't you tweak the color of the text "The most important things are not things"?  Please explain. This portion cannot be changed because it is all an imported gif/picture. 

* Go to www.ticketswizard.com and analyze the page.  
  * What is the largest image on the website? https://oauth.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/js/core:rpc:shindig.random:shindig.sha1.js?c=2 <--This file was the largest(core:rpc)
  * 
  * Explain how you would find out this information, and list the URL of offending image here and how big it is. You find out this information by inspecting the entire page.  From there, you click on network and then sort by size.  

* Test the www.ticketswizard.com website with google's [PageSpeed Insights](http://www.ticketswizard.com/).  (You can also download the chrome plugin).  What is the lowest hanging fruit to optimize the website?  How many kilobytes of data can be eliminated?
* 
Optimize Images- can reduce size by 885 KB
Minify CSS- roughly 5 KB
Serve contents from a consistent URL- 800 KB roughly.

This is just to name a few, but these appear to be the lowest hanging fruit on this page.
