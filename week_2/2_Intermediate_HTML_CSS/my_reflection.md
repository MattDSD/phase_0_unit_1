# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?  I think that web standards are a necessary aspect of building a web page, so obviously I believe that they are good.  In order for a web page to communicate with the WWW our page requires HTML, CSS and Javascript.  In order to build a page that our computer/web will understand, it is important to have standards that are consistent regardless of who is writing them.  
* 
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?  
*From what I learned in this section, the standard structure makes perfect sense.  I have a better understanding of the role HTML, CSS and Javascript play in web development.  I also have a better understanding of each tag and its role within HTML/CSS.  The standard structure that we use to design websites also makes sense from a braoder picture.  

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* 
I do like the new HTML5 elements.  I think the new semantic elements very obvious to a browser and the web developer.  By obvious, I mean that when you see <header>, there is a clear understanding that this tag is signifying the start of a 'header'.  

This simple language makes code more readable and treatable.  
* 
* Why is reset.css necessary?
* 
* If I'm not mistaken, reset.css is used so that you can see exactly how your page will look before adding CSS elements to your HTML. I'm sure this can be an important feature for many developers.  If you have an error with your CSS, you could use reset.css to revert your page to a time before it had CSS elements and add each element back individually.  This gives the developer control to debug exactly where an error is located. 
* 
From a designing standpoint, reset.css also allows a developer to see exactly how their page will be viewed by users before adding CSS.  The developer/UX Designer can then diagram exactly how they would like to style their page. 
* 

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* 
I have used Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Internet Explorer, various mobile browsers and Opera for roughly 4 seconds.  I actually did not really notice that there is a difference from browser to browser until you mentioned it.  I mostly use Chrome for everything.  

After reading this question though, I checked out several pages in different browsers and noticed subtle differences.  If I had to choose whether this is a good or bad thing, I would have to side with bad.  For a web developer, that means that you must test your web app or website on each of the major browsers to ensure that it will work properly.  From a user standpoint, this could also be considered a bad thing because people that are using different platforms will have different experiences using your website.  That being said, it is important for an engineering team to standardize the UX/UI as much as possible so the UE is consistent.

I strangely was able to find a good amount of info on Wikipedia
