# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? I have two time management issues to overcome during Phase 0: work and traveling.  The travel issue is a good issue to have.  I am going to Jamaica with my girlfriend from May 20th-28th and then I am going to Peru from June 1st to June 10th.  During the time that I am abroad, I will need to ensure that I devote time each day to Phase 0 materials.  The same goes for work.  
* 
* How will you combat that? I will combat this by setting deadlines and mandatory DBC times for myself.  By holding myself to a schedule, I will feel obligated to complete the material within the allotted time.  
* 
* What techniques will you try? I plan to dive deeper into Mindful Meditation, for one.  I have been practicing this form of meditation for several months and it has been wonderful.  I intend ot continue practicing this as well as diving deeper into the practice.  I think this will do wonders for the way that I approach the challeneges ahead of me.  Additionally, I would like to begin cementing 'best practices' by using the Fogg Method.  I think this seems like a great way to affirm that I am headed down the right path.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
* 
My overall plan for Phase 0 is to gather as much programming information as possible before Phase 1.  Also, I want to cement as many good habits as I possibly can so that I am more efficient and balanced during the latter stages.
