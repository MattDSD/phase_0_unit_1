## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


git add
This command allows you to add files to your repo. 

#### branch
<!-- Your defnition here -->

git checkout index.html
This allows us to change files back to how they were at the last commit. 

#### clone
<!-- Your defnition here -->

git commit -m "Leave note about changes"
<!-- Your defnition here -->
This command allows you to upload and changes to your repo and leave notes about the changes you made. 

#### fetch
<!-- Your defnition here -->

git log
Keeps track of all of the changes/commits that we have made so far 

#### merge
<!-- Your defnition here -->

git pull origin master 
allows us to track users work that have pulled our code, committed them and pushed them.  

git push -u origin master 
this function tells github where to commit our files when we are ready to commit them to our repo.  Origin stands for 
Master.  Also -u lets github know to remember which folder we are committing to so we only have to use git push in the future. 


git reset filename.txt
allows us to remove files from staging. 

#### rm
<!-- Your defnition here -->

git status
This command gives you the status of the current directory that you are in.  Have the files recently been committed, what 
files were recently added, most recent commit notes, etc.
