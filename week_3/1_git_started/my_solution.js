## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


git add
This command allows you to add files to your repo. 

git branch
you would use this command to delete a branch
git checkout index.html
This allows us to change files back to how they were at the last commit. 

git clone
we use this to clone a local repository to your computer.  This is done when you are collaborating with someone on a project. 

git commit -m "Leave note about changes"
<!-- Your defnition here -->
This command allows you to upload and changes to your repo and leave notes about the changes you made. 

git fetch
download new files and data from a remote repository.  This would be similar to what we had to do at week 2. 

git log
Keeps track of all of the changes/commits that we have made so far 

git merge
merge two branches together. 

git pull origin master 
allows us to track users work that have pulled our code, committed them and pushed them.  

git push -u origin master 
this function tells github where to commit our files when we are ready to commit them to our repo.  Origin stands for 
Master.  Also -u lets github know to remember which folder we are committing to so we only have to use git push in the future. 


git reset filename.txt
allows us to remove files from staging. 

git rm "file".html
Remove files from your git

git status
This command gives you the status of the current directory that you are in.  Have the files recently been committed, what 
files were recently added, most recent commit notes, etc. 


## Release 4: Git Workflow

- Push files to a remote repository
- Fetch changes
- Commit locally

## Release 5: Reflection

//My Cheat Sheet for pushing files a repository, fetching the changes, and then committing locally

//Initialize a Repo- Git init (short for initialize)
//Push file to remote repo- git push github master (git push (alias) (branch))
//git status- check status to see what was pushed 
//
//Check repo status to determine exactly what actions took place - git status
//fetch changes- git pull github 
//committing locally- 
//Create file- mkdir filename
//Commit changes to a remote repository - git remote add (file name or --all)
//Commit changes - git commit -m "note"
