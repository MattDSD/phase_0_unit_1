Hey guys,

I hope you all had a great week.  Here is my reflection for Challenge 7. 

My name is Matt Darin and I live in San Diego, CA.  I'm actually from Cincinnati, OH, but I have been in San Diego for a little over 3 years.  I'm brand new to programming, but I am looking forward to the journey and I look forward to working with you all over the next few months. 

Favorite Website: Stumbleupon & Kentuckysportsradio.com (I'm a University of Kentucky alumni/huge UK Basketball fan)

Learning Style: After completing the VARK assessment, I learned that I have a multimodal VARK learning style.  My assessment came back pretty balanced across the board, with most scores near 15.  

When I am learning something technical, like programming or mathematics I prefer to see visual demonstrations to help me through it.  As far as teaching style, I sometimes tend to teach using charts and graphs.  I became pretty accustomed to working with charts/graphs during college (econ major).

Have a great weekend, 

Matt 

2. Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

I think I am starting to see that many of us are in the same boat.  Initially, it appeared that some people were substantially ahead of me experience-wise.  This may still may be true in some cases, but I am also starting to learn that we all have different skill sets that can be combined to do great things.  I think we all have similar concerns and fears.  That definitely makes me feel like I'm not alone.  We are all going to be going through this together and that's a good feeling.  My experience this week has been a bit stressful and it probably won't let up much throughout Phase 0.  I will be traveling, moving and working throughout this process, so that will all just add to the confusion.  

I have the discipline and intelligence to get through this though.  I will see you all June 23rd.
