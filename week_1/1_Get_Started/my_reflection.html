## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process? I struggled initially setting up Git through Terminal.  For whatever reason, I could not get it to install through terminal.  I was able to set this up by downloading through an external link though.  I learned that there is more than one way to skin a cat (weirdest phrase of all time) 
*
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. Git is essentially a managment control system that keeps a copy of progress, tracks progress, and compiles all files into one workable project.  I also noted that Git is stored locally on my computer.  GitHub is a 'hub' that is stored on the internet, not locally.  It is a site that allows multiple programmers, in different places to collaborate on a project.  Again, all files that are uploaded to GitHub are part of a larger project, instead of tons of related files saved separately. 
* 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it. Version control is a program that keeps track of the changes that are made to a file.  It is sort of like Time Machine for Mac.  If I make a mistake with a program, Version Control allows me to go back to an earlier, working version of my code.  Version control also allows multiple people to work on the same code without saving over the other persons work. 
* 
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not? Developers use version control/git because it makes it easier for multiple people to collaborate on a single project from various locations.  Git also tracks changes and allows you to revert back to a period when your code was workable, if something were to break.  I believe I understand this concept. 
* 
* What doesn't make sense? What does? I think that I have a good understanding of Git v. GitHub v. Version Control and how they are all intertwined.  I do not understand many of the commands to use in Terminal surround git.  I also need to familiarize myself with GitHub so I understand how to be more effective in the future with it.

In summary, I was able to learn a bit more about the difference between git and github.  I know where each of these programs are stored and when to use each program.  I now understand why both of these programs are used and how they are used within the developer community.  Action items: I need to familiarize myself with github and git commands a bit more over the next couple days.  I also need to familiarize myself with Terminal commands more.
