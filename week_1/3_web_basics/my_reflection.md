## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web? I learned how the Internet is intertwined with the WWW.  I always thought the two were interchangeable.  I also learned how the DNS works and how to record changes in git. 
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site? 

If your goal is to drive traffic to your site, you should ensure that that SEO is a consdiration when setting up HTML.  Basically your HTML should be SEO optimized.  I would also assume that it is important to ensure that your HTML is properly labeled, indented and is readable.  This will allow you to make changes and collaborate with other easily. 

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live? ECSTATIC.. woooo 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified? When I finally discovered how to access sublime and git through my command line, I had an 'aha' moment.  I am very new to Terminal, so every few seconds, I am amazed by what I was able to do through Terminal. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it:
