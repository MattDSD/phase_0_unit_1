I learned that design and user experience is sometimes just as important as your product, if not more important.  Each and every aspect of the application must be designed with the user in mind.  I watched a one hour movie called, "Objectified" and I have also been reading Web Design books. My goal is to build web apps with the user in mind so the user experience is optimal. 

I asked questions about how the website was able to place pictures behind buttons.  I used several CSS help pages to help me get to my answer. 

I am having a bit of trouble using github from the command line.  I just need to learn the commands and they will eventually become second nature.  Also, I am having a bit of trouble determing how to pad divs. Again, this will come with time and experience. 

I learned a great deal of new skills throughout this project.  Puru and I dissected, the DBC "Pairing is Caring" site and rebuilt it from scratch.  This proved to be an extremely challenging project, but it taught us more advanced CSS tactics.  Our site looks almost identical to the actual site.  I learned more about divs, floats, CSS in general, and HTML structures.

One a scale of 1-10 regarding confidence, I would say that I am about a 6.  I feel confident that I could redo the project without completing it as a pair programming assignemnt, but it would take a lot of time. 

My favorite part of this challenge was learning what it takes to build a site.  Even sites that look fairly simple to build have some parts that take careful thought and consideration.  

I found it tedious to build divs and determine, height, weight and padding.  Many of those aspects required a great deal of trial and error.  The whole experience was still rewarding and interesting.
