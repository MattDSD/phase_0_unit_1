## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? The actual layout HTML makes perfect sense. I understand syntax, tags, and how to nest tags.  The one thing that doesn't make sense at the moment, is centering <ul> and <ol>.  When I tried to center these, it centered the content, but not the actual numbers or bullet points. 
* 
* What seems good and bad about HTML? HTML is great because it allows you to build the skeleton for a website fairly quickly.  However, it is slightly limited because it can only build static websites with very little bells and whistles.  The bells and whistles come in with CSS.  
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified? I had an aha moment when I was just seeing it all come together.  Learning about each little intricacy was a rewarding experience. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
