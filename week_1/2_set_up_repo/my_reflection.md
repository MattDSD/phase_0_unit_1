## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
*   The first thing you will want to do is log in to your Github account.  Once you are inside of your account, look in the top rigth hand corner next to your pretty mugshot.  You will see a "+" sign next to your picture, click on it and then click "New Repository".  From here, you will want to title your repository, give a brief description as a reminder of its contents, determine if you would like this to be public or private, and then choose a license that is applicable to the work you will be doing.  Click "Create Repository" and you are more than halfway there.  Now you will want to download the GitHub application to your computer (I am assuming that I have provided the user instructions on how to download the local app).  You can open this app, do a simple search for the repository you created.  You will want to search based on the title you made on github.com.  Once you find the repository, click "clone to computer" and you can now have a local repository linked to your online github. 
* Describe what open source means
* Open source refers to software or programs that are open to the public to contribute as they see fit.  This refers to programs such as Mozilla Firefox.  OSS will allow programmers to see what has been added to the code and then contribute. 
* 
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia? I like Open Source a lot.  I am a huge believer that some of the most life changing ideas and applications were created by a team vs. an individual (ie. Apple).  If I were to create a wonderful idea that could benefit from the contributions of other experienced developers, I would happily allow others to contribute through Open Source.  However, if I needed to maintain 100% control of my product, I would not choose to go OS because control can be lost (this was highlighted during the Adobe example).
* Assess the importance of using licenses.  Licenses are important because they offer/restrict certain freedoms whilst using the software that is Open Source.  The various licenses have different restrictions that must be taken into consideration.  These licenses are important because they are legally binding and dictate terms of using the license.  Should you breach the contract, you are potentially facing legal issues. 
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?  I fully understand Open Source, how to create a repository, and how to better navigate github.  The 'aha' moment for me was learning about the various license options.  This was all new news to me. 
* 
The only part I struggled with a bit was navigating github.com and the github application.  I am totally new to programming, so there are certainly some growing pains using these programs. 
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I am thrilled to be learning all of this new information in such a condensed manner.  I truly see the value of git/github and I am starting to feel more comfortable with each.  Open Source now makes perfect sense to me and I have a better understanding of the need for various licenses.  On to the next lesson!
